# Diabetes-Prediction
This project is a part of my machine learning learning phase where I built a predictive model to classify whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical diagnostic data. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
